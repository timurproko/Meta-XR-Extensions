  blockName: XR Panel Group
  description: "Enables XR Panel Groups\u2014a setup for bundling multiple world-space
    interaction panels into a single, coherent XR UI surface. It provides a foundation
    for seamless multi-panel behavior, including shared interaction rules, consistent
    layering, and unified manipulation (e.g., XR Panel Movement: grab/move/align
    panels as one group while preserving each panel\u2019s local layout)."

  usageInstructions: "Note: This block provides a baseline XR Panel Group configuration
    for Meta XR / OpenXR projects. Use it to keep multiple panels behaving like one
    \u201CUI cluster\u201D (common transforms, bounds, and interaction settings)
    instead of managing each panel independently. For best results, define a clear
    group root, ensure all child panels use consistent scale, sorting/layering, and
    collider/bounds rules, and tune movement to feel stable in 3D space (snapping,
    smoothing, constraints). Consider performance when grouping many panels\u2014prefer
    fewer, larger panels when possible, and keep redraw-heavy UI elements minimal
    during movement."
